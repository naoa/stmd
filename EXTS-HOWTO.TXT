How to customize exts (external stemmer)

1. Write a stemmer that reads from stdin and writes out to stdout.
Text should encoded UTF-8.
A three character sequence: "\newline SEPARATOR_C \newline" is a
message boundary, and your stemmer should recognize this sequence.
The stemmer should write out a line that begins with a SEPARATOR_C,
whenever it encounters a message boundary(*). Do not forget to flush
output buffer after writing out a message boundary.
SEPARATOR_C is defined in extsutil.c (default: 037) and you may choose 
any single byte, but avoid characters grater than 0x7f which break
UTF-8 well-formedness.

(*) If you want to change this behavior, find following line in extutil.c
		if (*c->rcvbuf == SEPARATOR_C) {
 then modify this line.  e.g. if your stemmer writes "--\n" as a message 
 boundary, the following code will suffice:
		if (strcmp(c->rcvbuf, "--\n") == 0) { 


2. Modify extsutil.c to call your stemmer.
A macro EXTS_CMD specifies external stemmer's absolute path.
Modify EXTS_CMD to point your stemmer. (relative path may not be allowed.)
exts_default_argv is command line arguments to your stemmer.
The first argument should a path to the command itself,
and the list should ended with a `NULL'. See the following example.

example:
#define	EXTS_CMD STMD_MYSTEMMER_DIR "stmd-exts.sh"
static char *exts_default_argv[] = {EXTS_CMD, "-b", "65536", NULL};
#define	SEPARATOR_C 037

If commas (,) appear in a stemmer name that passed to ystem,
the name is split up into fragments by comma.
Then the first fragment becomes the true name (of course, it must be "exts").
The rests become arguments to EXTS_CMD which overrides exts_default_arg.
e.g. if you want change buffer size, use "exts,-b,8192" as a stemmer name.
You cannot override EXTS_CMD.


3. Write a post-processing filter for your stemmer
Modify a function exts_linefil defined in extsutil.c.
In exts_linefil, q->surface holds a line received from your stemmer.
Modify this function to return a word what you want.
You may destroy the contents of q->surface.
q->surface will be destroyed upon next call to exts_sparse_tostr.
If you want to discard current line, return a NULL.


4. Test your stemmer with extsdbg.
extsdbg provides a simple debugging program for your new stemmer.
extsdbg simulates stmd's behavior, so that you can check what is
going to happen between stmd and your stemmer, interactively.
